# YoutubeAdBlocker

To skip the video ad, run this JS code:

```js
const video = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream")[0];
const skipButton = document.getElementsByClassName("ytp-ad-skip-button")[0];
video.currentTime = video.duration;
skipButton.click();
```

This line of code is sufficient for skipping the 5s-must-watch type of ads:

```js
document.getElementsByClassName("ytp-ad-skip-button")[0].click();
```

The rest of the block is for skipping the unskippable ads..
We will know soon enough once they appear. ðŸŽ‰

The extension skips the main ad automatically now and hides all type of ads. âœ…

## Notes

There are three scripts and here is the utility of each one of them:

`script.js`

- contains the popup's logic
- gets data that are shown in the popup from the local storage
- it notifies all Youtube tabs when the extension is enabled/disabled

`service-worker.js`

- always running in the background
  - either active or inactive
  - no activity for â‰ˆ10 seconds turns it into inactive mode
  - when a message is received it becomes active again
- listens for messages from the content-script.js
- has access to the extension's local storage and updates it when a message is received
- as soon as a message is received, the event listeners you create run their callback functions

`content-script.js`

- injected in the Youtube website
- blocks all types of ads
  - skips the 5s-must-be-watched ads
  - removes all ads that are displayed
- sends messages (that contain the duration of a skipped ad each time) to the content-script
- shows an alert informing asking for page reload when the popup's toggle switch is turned on/off

```

And there are 6 types of ads:

- Type 1: appears in the homepage
- Type 2: appears on top of the suggested list of videos
- Type 3: appears under the description
- Type 4: skippable 5-second-must-be-watched video ad that appears at the beginning of the video, in the middle or at end
- Type 5: similar to type 4 but 2 video ads appear in row and not only one
- Type 6: unskippable 10-second-must-be-watched video ad

**NB:**

- All data are saved in the local storage and that makes it a standalone app.
- The manifest is of version 3 that can be deployed to the Chrome Web Store without any editing.
- Code is formatted using Prettier default style guides.
- The components are taken from Flowbite UI that is based on Tailwind CSS.
