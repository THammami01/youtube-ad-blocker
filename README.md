# YoutubeAdBlocker

To skip the video ad, run this JS code:

```js
const video = document.getElementsByClassName("video-stream")[0];
const skipButton = document.getElementsByClassName("ytp-ad-skip-button")[0];
video.currentTime = video.duration;
skipButton.click();
```

This line of code is sufficient for skipping the 5s-must-watch type of ads:

```js
document.getElementsByClassName("ytp-ad-skip-button")[0].click();
```

The rest of the block is for skipping the unskippable ads..
We will know soon enough once they appear. ðŸŽ‰

The extension skips the main ad automatically now and hides all type of ads. âœ…

## Notes

There are three scripts and here the utility of each one of them:

`script.js`

- contains the popup's logic
- gets data that are shown in the popup from the local storage

`service-worker.js`

- always running in the background
  - either active or inactive
  - no activity for â‰ˆ10 seconds turns it into inactive mode
  - Chrome runs the listener callback when a message is received so it becomes active again
- listens for messages from the content-script.js
- has access to the extension's local storage and does updates when a message is received

`content-script.js`

- injected in the Youtube website
- blocks all types of ads
  - skips the 5s-must-watch ads
  - removes all ads that are displayed
- sends messages (that contain the duration of a skipped ad each time) to the content-script

**NB:**

- All data are saved in local storage and that makes it a standalone app.
- The manifest is of V3 that can deployed to the Chrome Web Store without any editing.
- Code is formatted using Prettier default style guides.
- The components are taken from Flowbite UI that is based on Tailwind CSS.

## Todos

- Add enable/disable functionality.
- Add stats of the current day/week/month.
- In case the extension does not works properly when it is enabled/disabled, show an alert to confirm the reload of the page (I am not sure if this will work properly or not so this could be a simple solution).
